### Technical Challenges/Research
- *Chess* MVP was built in less than 48 hours
- Special moves like *En Passants* and *Castling* required unique logic that deters other standard moves
- Check and Checkmate are dependant on more than the vector created by the most recently used piece

# Client Deliverables
The following user stories  were developred to track deliverables and meet the expectations of the client:

#### User Stories
* As a user I should be able to input my own username to play with
* As a user I should be able to move pieces to all of their allowed locations
* As a user I should see when I am in check or have checked my opponent
* As a user I should be allowed to move out of check if possible
* As a user I should see I have won when checkmating my opponent
* As a user I should be able to reset the game

## Minimum Viable Product 
The MVP of the app is a playable chess game by two players
